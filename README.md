# DimensionPortals
This plugin lets players build nether portals and end portals, and use them to teleport between worlds. This plugin supports 

Although this plugin does not generate nether and end dimension terrain, various plugins that do so exist.
Therefore, you may want to supplement DimensionPortals with the following plugins:
- [BetterGen](https://github.com/Ad5001/BetterGen) - Generates more enhanced-looking biomes (if you are looking to build custom dimensions)
- [MultiWorld](https://github.com/CzechPMDevs/MultiWorld) - Generates overworld, nether, and end terrain (and a few kinds of custom terrain)
- [VanillaGenerator](https://github.com/Muqsit/VanillaGenerator) - Generates overworld and nether terrain

As of Minecraft Bedrock Edition v1.19.0, the following plugin(s) are required as a fix:
- [DimensionFix](https://github.com/Muqsit/DimensionFix) - Fixes appearance of "ghost" blocks in nether and end dimensions
